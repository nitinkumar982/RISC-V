##  Overview

This repository documents an advanced Edge AI project focused on implementing machine learning algorithms from regression to classification (KNN ‚Üí SVM) on the *VSDSquadron PRO board, powered by a **SiFive FE310-G002 RISC-V SoC*. The entire workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to 8-bit quantization and bare-metal C inference, is optimized for this low-power, resource-constrained microcontroller.

This work is part of the *VLSI System Design (VSD) RISC-V Edge AI with VSDSquadron Pro* course. It demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline from regression fundamentals to advanced classification algorithms, all deployed under the strict memory and processing limitations of an embedded system (16KB of SRAM), showcasing a complete "lab-to-fabric" Edge AI implementation.

##  Project Objective

The primary goal is to build a complete, embedded system for machine learning classification. The objectives are to:

1. *Master Regression Fundamentals:* Train polynomial regression models to understand non-linear relationships in data.
2. *Progress to Classification:* Implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for binary classification tasks.
3. *Optimize for the Edge:* Employ *post-training quantization* to convert models to 8-bit integer format, drastically reducing size for microcontroller deployment.
4. *Deploy on RISC-V:* Implement lightweight inference engines in C to run models on the SiFive FE310-G002, achieving robust classification performance on the edge device.

##  The Edge AI Challenge: Fitting ML Models in 16KB of RAM

Deploying machine learning models on microcontrollers like the SiFive FE310-G002 is non-trivial. A standard floating-point model can be several megabytes in size, while the target board has only *16KB of SRAM*. This project overcomes this challenge through:

* *Aggressive Quantization:* Converting all model parameters from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers. This reduces the model size by ~4x.
* *Optimized C-Inference:* Writing a minimal, bare-metal C function for inference that performs all calculations using integer arithmetic, avoiding the need for heavy floating-point libraries.
* *Feature Engineering:* Preprocessing input data to reduce dimensionality while maintaining classification accuracy.

##  Methodology & Deployment Pipeline

The project follows a structured pipeline from Python-based model development to C-based firmware deployment.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing & Model Training (Python)

To build robust models, the dataset was carefully prepared using Python:

* *Polynomial Regression:* Implemented non-linear regression to model relationships between features and targets, visualizing fitted curves against actual data points.
* *Classification Dataset:* Analyzed age vs. estimated salary data with binary classification (classes 0 and 1).
* *Data Normalization:* Scaled features for better model convergence and generalization.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Classification Models (Scikit-learn)

* *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):* Implemented distance-based classification with visualization of decision boundaries.
* *Support Vector Machine (SVM):* Explored multiple kernel functions:
  - *Linear Kernel:* For linearly separable data
  - *Polynomial Kernel:* For capturing curved decision boundaries
  - *RBF Kernel:* For highly non-linear classification tasks

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Neural Networks on RISC-V Microcontrollers

* *MLP Classifier:* Built Multi-Layer Perceptron with hidden layers (64, 32), ReLU activation, and Adam optimizer.
* *Training Performance:* Achieved *96% accuracy* on 60,000 training samples with 784 features.
* *Model Parameters:* 52,650 total trainable parameters.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Training Quantization (TensorFlow Lite)

* *Model Conversion:* After training, models were converted to TensorFlow Lite format and quantized to 8-bit integer (INT8) representation.
* *Size Reduction:* Critical step for reducing model size from megabytes to kilobytes suitable for embedded deployment.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ C-Code Generation & Bare-Metal Inference (RISC-V)

* *Model to C Array:* Converted .tflite model into C header and source files (model_params.h, model_params.c) containing quantized weights and biases as integer arrays.
* *Lightweight Inference Engine:* Wrote simple C functions to perform neural network operations using only integer arithmetic on the RISC-V core.
